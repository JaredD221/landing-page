With that knowledge I hope to be able to create my own game someday whether it be simple or complex as long as the game is fun that will be fine by me. Currently, I am studying at Eastern Washington University and I plan to graduate by 2026. After graduation, I plan to find a position with a game development team whether it be big or small.",
