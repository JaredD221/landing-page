        "bio": "My name is Jared Alexis Diaz, and I am a computer science student studying at Eastern Washington University. My favorite pastime is gaming, and it's rare for a day to go by without me playing at least one video game. I consider myself to be very introverted, but I am more than happy to tackle a project with a team, whether in groups of two or more. I have a wonderful girlfriend named Leslie, who is my biggest motivation for my studies. She is amazing at staying consistent with work and assignments. Without her, I don’t think I would have had the courage to stay in school, let alone pursue computer science! If you haven’t visited my GitHub.io page, I have a cat named Morro that Leslie and I adopted. He's a bit of a mean little guy, but he warms up to you eventually—with enough treats. My biggest goal right now is to create a game studio with Leslie so that we can both produce video games that we hope will be fun and entertaining to most, if not all.",
