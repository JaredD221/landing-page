        "bio": "My name is Jared Diaz. I am a computer Science student studing at Eastern Washington University, My most favorite pass time ever is gaming. It is rare for a day to go by without me playing at least one video game. I consider myself to be very introverted but I am more than happy to tackle a project with a team wether it be in groups of two or more. I have a very lovely girlfriend named leslie who is my biggest motivation ever for my studies, she is amazing at staying consistent with work/assignments. With out her I dont think I would have even had the courage to stay in school, let alone to even try Computer Science! If you haven't visited my GitHub.io page I have a cat named Morro that me and leslie adopted. He's a mean little guy, but he warms up to you eventually. My biggest goal right now is to create a game studio with leslie so that we can both produce video games that we hope will be fun and intertaining to most if not all.",
